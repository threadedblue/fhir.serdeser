# FHIRSDS
## FHIR Serialize/Deserialize
FHIRSDS works in the hands of its maker but none other.

It is primarily a set of functions that can be called statically to manipulate an EObject that is the super type of a FHIR resource.  

### FHIRSDS loads and saves FHIR resources to and from XML. JSON.  RDF is not supported.

### FHIRAA loads and saves to AA (associative array)

### FHIRPath is supposed to output a collection of FHIRPaths for a given resource.  It might not be working.

### FHIRProfiler is supposed to read a StructuredDefinition then generate a FHIR resource contstrained according to the definition.  not complete not sure it will be needed.
